## ðŸ’¡ Prompting Tips & Examples

The quality of your output is directly related to the quality of your prompt. Here are some examples to guide you.

### Character

Focus on physical traits, clothing, equipment, and personality. Remember, this preset automatically asks for a T-pose on a neutral background.

**Example Prompt:**
```
A female elf rogue, athletic build, with long silver hair in a braid, piercing green eyes, and pointed ears. She wears dark leather armor with intricate silver clasps, a hooded cloak, and carries a pair of ornate daggers on her belt.
```
- **Art Style**: `Photorealistic`
- **Color Palette**: `Earthy Tones`
- **Negative Prompt**: `bulky armor, smiling`

*This prompt is effective because it gives concrete details about the character's appearance, equipment, and implies a serious personality.*

### Background

Describe the environment, mood, lighting, and key elements. Think like a set designer.

**Example Prompt:**
```
A sprawling, bio-luminescent alien jungle at night. Giant, glowing mushrooms cast an eerie blue light on strange, exotic plants. A cascading waterfall of shimmering liquid in the distance. The mood is mysterious and magical.
```
- **Art Style**: `Cartoon`
- **Color Palette**: `Neon Glow`
- **Negative Prompt**: `daytime, harsh shadows`

*This prompt works well because it establishes a clear time of day, atmosphere (mood), and specific visual elements (glowing mushrooms, waterfall).*

### Item

Be specific about the object's material, shape, details, and any magical effects. This preset helps isolate the object.

**Example Prompt:**
```
An ancient, leather-bound spellbook lying open on a stone table. The pages are yellowed and filled with glowing arcane symbols. A single, large amethyst crystal is embedded in the center of the cover.
```
- **Art Style**: `Watercolor`
- **Color Palette**: `Monochromatic` (with purple hues)
- **Negative Prompt**: `modern, clean, new`

*This prompt is successful because it details the item's materials (leather, stone, amethyst), state (open, yellowed), and special effects (glowing symbols).*

### Vehicle

Define the vehicle's type, style, condition, and key features. Think about its purpose and the world it belongs to.

**Example Prompt:**
```
A rugged, post-apocalyptic buggy. It's built from scrap metal, with large off-road tires, a reinforced roll cage, and rusted metal plates for armor. A powerful supercharged engine is exposed on the hood.
```
- **Art Style**: `Photorealistic`
- **Color Palette**: `Earthy Tones`
- **Negative Prompt**: `clean, shiny, new, futuristic`

*This prompt is effective because it clearly defines the vehicle's theme (post-apocalyptic), construction materials (scrap metal), and notable features (off-road tires, exposed engine).*
